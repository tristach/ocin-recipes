    <h1>Rosemary Chicken</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Put chicken breast, thighs, or bascially anything in a pan.  Cover it with salt, pepper and rosemarry and bake it.  It's not rocket science dumb-dumb, it's dinner:).</p>
    <p>All joking aside, this is a family favorite.  The fresh rosemary gives it a really rustic flavor and it couldn't be easier.</p>
    <p>For add-ons, simply throw carrots, onions, potatoes, anything you've got really into the pan and let it come along for the ride.</p>
    <p>Works well with pork, beef, lamb, etc. too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken (stupid)</li>
        <li>rosemary (maybe you didn't see the name?)</li>
        <li>salt (duh..)</li>
        <li>pepper (even more duh.....)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put spices on the chicken and put it in the pan (did I really need to type that?  LOL).</li>
        <li>Pour yourself a glass of wine or beer (depending on weather outside).</li>
        <li>Bake at 180 ã‚œcelcius for 30 minutes, or until internal temp. is 42 celcius.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for 5-10 minutes once done cooking (or not depending on how hungry you are).</li>
        <li>Put it on a plate and eat it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>NOTES</h4>
    <p>For those of you who really wanna show off or something, go ahead and pre-heat the pan, cover the chicken in olive oil, marande it, add lemon, etc.  My point is this, the basics never change.  Any quality meat with fresh, (key word there is FRESH) rosemary will taste like a million bucks and make you seem like a hero and that you've spent a lot mroe time on this recipe than you actually did.  So don't let details get in the way of a recipe your family will love.</p>
