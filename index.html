    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p><strong>The Legend begins:  And low, Saint Barney, Son of Odin, brother-in-law of Thor, member of bowling-team, spoke to the kingdom, "Let them cook, and be free!" Said Barney unto the masses.</p>
    <p>Thus, the legend began, and dads from all walks of life took to the kitchen, reclaiming the spatula and our birthright as honored members of the clan.
    </strong>
        <p>But on the decree from Saint Barney, there was more.  The three central rules that all recipes on this page will follow:
        <ol>
            <li>No more than three ingredients shall thine use.</li>
            <li>No more than thirty minutes shalt thine family wait!</li>
            <li>Wine shall be used not just for deglazing and in food prep, but for drinking as well!</li>
        </ol>
    <p>It is possible (one might ask oneself)?  Can one really prepare wholesome meals in less than 30 minutes, using only 3 ingredients or less?  The answer my friends, is a resounding YES!</p>
    <p>But how, Barney?  How?</p>
    <H2>The answer lies in these simple tricks:</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>The oven is your friend, use it: cut, slice and prep to a minimum.  Throw it in a pan and let the oven do the dirty work.</li>
            <li>Marante, maranate, maranate:  Saves prep time and maxes out flavor (and the number of things you can throw into said oven).</li>
            <li>Ingredients count:  Fresh rosemary, basil and thyme make even simple recipes fly off rthe shelf.  Spend your time on small things like a rosemary bush outside (next to the trash if you have to) or on a small herb garden in your kitchen.  Minimal work for maximum flavors.</li>
            <li>Have the mininions help:  To keep complaints to a minimum, have your kids help you.  You'd be amazed at how much this cuts down on complaints on food (and the full you'll have cooking with loved ones).</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><strong>Can I change the recipes?  What about if I want to use more than 3 ingredients?  Can I drink other things besides wine?</strong></h3>
    <p>The answers to those questions are as follows:  Yes, yes and yes.  Always adapt and change as you see fit.  The ideas below are just starters, the real magic lies in you.  Oh, and never forget, Ben Franklin even called wine “constant proof that God loves us”.  So if it's good enough for ol'Ben, it's good enough for me. </p>
